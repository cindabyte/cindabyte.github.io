Day 1 | We are hungry! Totally wasn't prepared to make 3 complete paleo meals in one day. Shiitake mushroom is awesome! 

Bone Broth 

Breakfast  
Berry Smoothie 
blueberries, strawberries, 3 bananas and water 

Lunch 
Leftover stir fry rice 
shredded chicken breast, shiitake mushroom, cauliflower rice 

Dinner 
Pork Chops (skipped the bacon and didn't use the oven)
Pork & Cabbage Soup (used cabbage instead of napa, tasted great!) 
Cauliflower Rice
